# Project Overview

## Overview
A 2D platformer with the requirement that the player can walk, run, jump and take damage. The game will contain enemies and pickups. The client has also requested to take care of the artistic elements of the game, leaving the programming work to us. It is expected that we will lay the foundation for future development of the game by creating modular and expandable code, in adherence to the Unity Coding conventions to also maintain readability. More specifically, the client should be able to easily implement additional levels, enemies and pickups. Gameplay wise, should feel like similar to old-school Mario games.
