>(2D sprites or 3D models - Must be sidescrolling).
>I want to focus on the art and I’m not so good with programming.
> I would need the game to be laid out in a way I could make levels, and enemies, control a player, and create pickups. 
>I would like the player to be able to walk, run, jump, and be damaged.
>This would be very similar to the old-school Mario games!
>However, I want to put my art spin on it.
