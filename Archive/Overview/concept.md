[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Midnight Woods is a game where the player explores a mystical forest under a starlit sky, where mysteries unfold and danger lurks in
every corner. In this 2D platformer, players will navigate the mysterious yet foreboding terrain, leaping from platforms veiled in the shadows
of trees, illuminated only by the soft glow of moonlight. Players will encounter a host of unique enemies, such as those forged from dead star matter.
Throughout the landscape, the player may also encounter fragments of fallen stars that host a unique array of abilities and powerups
which will aid the player in progressing through the mysterious landscape to solve the mystery of the land.
