# Outcome 

## Project
The overall outcome for this project is to make a working prototype of the sidescroller platformer which will cover all of the requirments the client wished for.
Such as basic player movement, enemies and pickups.
The project should also have the player to be able to react in some way to the enemies or pickups, whether thats taking damage or getting a power up.
