# Loops and Gameplay

## The primary Gameplay loop
The expected gameplay loop is as follows:
Move -> Complete Platforming Segments -> Jump on Enemies -> Collect Pickups to power your character -> Destroy more enemies -> Advance to the end of the level

## Game Feel - From Start to Finish

When the player first boots up the game, they should be greeted by a main menu with the ability to press play. The user should be prompted with a level selection screen; naturally only level one is available to the player will advance to level 1. Upon entering the first level, not much danger should be present to give the player the opportunity to explore their surroundings momentarily. Enemy design and placement should be simple, with pickups consciously placed on alternative paths to encourage exploration. In order to advance to the next level, the player should reach the end of the stage and ideally clear a few enemies that may be blocking the path required to advance to the finish.
