# Risks 

## Types of Risks
Miscommunication: can lead to lack of efficiency and/or misunderstanding of an idea.

No meetups: wont know what the other person has done or if everyone is on the same page.

Not saving: not having work/projects on backups or saves are at risk of being unrecoverable if they get lost or corrupted. 

## Mitigate Risks
Clear communication: makes it easier for teammates to understand each other.

Checkins: contact team members to ensure everyone is up-to-date and voice any problems.

Backups: having multiple backups so nothing is lost and if adding a new component it wont impact everything.
