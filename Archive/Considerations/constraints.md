# Constraints 

## Quality
Some things dont need to be extremely high quality such as any background models.
Others should have an appropriate amount of detail, especially if there at the forefront.



## Time
Need to ensure our time is used correctly and appropriately due to having a limited amount of time to get everything done.
Also DON'T use lots of time on little or out of the way assets.

Both of us have more experience in Unreal Engine, working in an unfamiliar environment (i.e Unity) can hinder progress somewhat as we learn to familiarise ourself with the new working environment.
The client specifies they'd like to "put their own art spin" on the game, therefore it is uneccessary to spend tiem creating a majority of the assets when they will be supplied for us.

## Technical Problems
Sometimes during a game development project such as this, some common issues team members may run into are mismatching versions of software. A great, and very realistic example of this is Unity. It is important that each project member uses the correct version of Unity and has source control set up to avoid file corruption.

## Scope
It is very easy to get overzealous with the scope of your project, hence why it is important to have retrospect and reflection when working on sizeable projects such as this. It is not uncommon for developers to be halfway through a development cycle to realize that due to the scope of their project, their time and/or financial budget won't allow all the features to be implemented in a timely manner. Using the three point rule, we can allow ourselves realistic expectations when it comes to the scope of our project.
