# Constraints 

## Quality
Some things dont need to be extremely high quality such as any background models.
Others should have an appropriate amount of detail, especially if there at the forefront.



## Time
Need to ensure our time is used correctly and appropriately due to having a limited amount of time to get everything done.
Also DON'T use lots of time on little or out of the way assets.

Both of us have more experience in Unreal Engine, working in an unfamiliar environment (i.e Unity) can hinder progress somewhat as we learn to familiarise ourself with the new working environment.
The client specifies they'd like to "put their own art spin" on the game, therefore it is uneccessary to spend tiem creating a majority of the assets when they will be supplied for us.
