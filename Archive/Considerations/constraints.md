# Constraints 

## Quality
Some things dont need to be extremely high quality such as any backrounud models.
Others should have an appropriate amount of detail, especially if there at the forefront.

## Time
Need to ensure our time is used correctly and appropriately due to having a limited amount of time to get everything done.
Also DON'T use lots of time on little or out of the way assets.
