### Project Name
Midnight Woods

### Description !Written with context under [here](project_justification.md)!
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Midnight Woods is a game where the player explores a mystical forest under a starlit sky, where mysteries unfold and danger lurks in
every corner. In this 2D platformer, players will navigate the mysterious yet foreboding terrain, leaping from platforms veiled in the shadows
of trees, illuminated only by the soft glow of moonlight. Players will encounter a host of unique enemies, such as those forged from dead star matter.
Throughout the landscape, the player may also encounter fragments of fallen stars that host a unique array of abilities and powerups
which will aid the player in progressing through the mysterious landscape to solve the mystery of the land.



### Key Features:

Magical Forest Setting - Explore a beautifully crafted world through otherwordly forests that combine the dark and mysterious
atmosphere of the woods with the intrigue of the night sky.

Dynamic Enemies - Battle against creatures made from remnants of stars, each sporting a unique moveset and behaviour.

Collect fragments of star matter to unlock new abilities to boost your powers.
