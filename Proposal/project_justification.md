# Justification
[//]: # (This section is an example of justifying your design and development decisions.)

## Overview

### Brief
[//]: # (What was the client's brief?)
The client is seeking a proof of concept for a game that is simple and big on art
* Users should be drawn to the game by its simple but unique visuals
* The gameplay can be fast-paced, or can be slow-paced depending on the player actions

### Communication
* When do you need this prototype by?
> I need the prototype by Friday Week 13.

* What kind of games do you think are good?
> Any simple game as long as it has a good or unique art style.

* Since you only need a prototype, are you happy for us to focus on gameplay and use based geometry for art assets?
> That is alright, however if your able to can you add some simple art assets to the game such as the player, enemies and pickups. This will help after the prototyping is done to find an artistic direction to do in. However if it impacts the prototyping to make jist keep it geometry based.

* Do you need a menu system?
> Yes a memu system would be greatly appreciated as im not a good coder my self. the menu should be able play the game from the menu, quit to the menu, quiting the game and pausing. 

* Are there any themes you think are popular or you would like to see in your game?
> Hmm... i guess it being in a forest under the night sky is pretty appeasing to the eye.

## Project Understanding

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product on 31 of May 2024.
* Sidescroller
* Platforner
* Player with walking ,running, jumping and can be damage
     * Can damage enemies
* Enemies
* Pickups

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Quality transparent project management (add the client)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art
    * Can use basic geometry
    * Should still look nice using colour palettes

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Big focus on the art quality
* Low focus on programming

## Risks

### Risks
[//]: # (What are the risks of this project)
* Unity and C# are excellent prototyping tools, but working quickly often means less than perfect code
    * Project may not be fit for use in further development
    * Bugs may be present in prototype due to the short turn-around
    * Working quickly is error-prone

### Risk Management
[//]: # (How are you managing the mentioned risks)
* All coding will aim to be designed in an extensible manner
* Testing will be undertaken throughout prototype development
* Using source control we will ensure our code is safe and usable at all times

## Constraints

### Constraints
[//]: # (What are the constraints of this project)
* We have a tight timeframe, so we will need to make fast decisions, which may be less than perfect

## Justification
We really liked the idea of it being in a forest. So we took your suggestion and begin going through many ideas, but finally came up with a title called "Midnight Woods".

The name helps us get a better idea of the direction we should take and we found ourselves popping out with countless ideas, we also took your comment about it being night into consideration as well and thought it would be amazing if the enemies were dead stars and the pickups were falling stars. This, we feel, would add to the forest and make it very magical as well.
